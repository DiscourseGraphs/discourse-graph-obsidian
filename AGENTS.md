### Icons
Platform-native UI.
Lucide and custom Obsidian icons can be used alongside detailed elements to provide a visual representation of a feature.

Example: In the ribbon on the left, select Create new canvas ( lucide-layout-dashboard.svg > icon ) to create a canvas in the same folder as the active file.

Guidelines for icons

Store icons in the Attachments/icons folder.
Add the prefix lucide- before the Lucide icon name.
Add the prefix obsidian-icon- before the Obsidian icon name.
Example: The icon for creating a new canvas should be named lucide-layout-dashboard.

Use the SVG version of the icons available.
Icons should be 18 pixels in width, 18 pixels in height, and have a stroke width of 1.5. You can adjust these settings in the SVG data.
Adjusting size and stroke in an SVG.
Utilize the icon anchor in embedded images, to tweak the spacing around the icon so that it aligns neatly with the text in the vicinity.
Icons should be surrounded by parenthesis. ( lucide-cog.svg > icon )
Example: ( ![[lucide-cog.svg#icon]] )
